This is a speed reader tool written in pyhton using PyGame

- word per minute can be set (defualt if 250). This changes when delay and punctuation delay are enabled.
- there is a few different pointers to choose from that enable better focus.

- delay will change the amount of time a word is show based on its length.
- punctuation delay will delay a word based on the punctuation used.
